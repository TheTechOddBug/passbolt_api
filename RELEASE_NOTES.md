Passbolt 5.8.0 introduces dynamic role management, allowing organizations to define additional roles that better align with internal policies, compliance requirements, and operational needs. This release also adds drag & drop user assignment to groups, simplifying day-to-day user and group management.

**Warning**: Ensure that all users have updated their browser extension to at least version 5.8 before assigning new roles. Otherwise, they will not be able to connect to Passbolt.

## Dynamic role management

As was already the case with the default User role, Passbolt allows administrators to restrict what users can do by limiting access to specific capabilities. With version 5.8, this model is extended beyond the default Admin and User roles, making it possible to create additional roles and assign them to users for more granular control.

Dynamic roles also enable the delegation of administrative responsibilities. Rather than granting full administrative access, administrators can now assign selected capabilities to custom roles and distribute operational tasks across multiple users. Initial support covers group creation, as well as handling account recovery requests in Passbolt Pro.

At this stage, dynamic role management comes with a defined scope and set of constraints.

- The default Admin and User roles keep fixed names and cannot be renamed or deleted.
- As before, the User role can be restricted, but it cannot be assigned delegated administrative responsibilities.
- The Admin role, by contrast, always retains access to all capabilities and cannot be restricted.
- Custom roles are currently limited to two per instance and support a first set of administrative capabilities.

This scope will be expanded progressively as additional needs and use cases are identified by the community.

## Drag & drop users to groups

Managing group membership often requires repetitive actions when working with large teams or frequently changing group structures. With Passbolt 5.8, administrators can now add users to a group by dragging them directly onto it from the Users & Groups workspace. This removes the need to open and edit each group individually and makes day-to-day group management faster and more fluid.

## Miscellaneous improvements

As usual, this release includes fixes and smaller improvements intended to improve the overall experience. For the full list of changes, please refer to the changelog.

Many thanks to everyone who provided feedback and helped refine these features.
